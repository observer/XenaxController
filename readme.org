* XenaxController Class Usage Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to utilize the XenaxController class for controlling XENAX controllers connected to a magnetic Linax RAILS, developed by [[https://www.jennyscience.com/de][Jenny Science AG]]. The class enables precise control over the controllers through network commands, including setting speed, acceleration, and moving to specific positions.

** Installation

To use the XenaxController class, ensure Python is installed on your system and that you have network connectivity to the Xenax controllers.

** Basic Operations

After initializing the controllers, you can perform operations such as connecting to the controller, moving to a specific position, setting the speed and acceleration, and retrieving the current position.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from XenaxController import XenaxController
import time

# Controller A Configuration - Custom speed and acceleration
controller_a = XenaxController(ip_address="192.168.2.120", limit_right=135000)
controller_a.connect()
controller_a.set_speed(50000)  # Custom speed for Controller A
controller_a.set_acceleration(500000)  # Custom acceleration for Controller A

# Controller B Configuration - Default speed and acceleration
controller_b = XenaxController(ip_address="192.168.2.101", limit_right=135000)
controller_b.connect()  # Using default speed and acceleration for Controller B

controllers = [controller_a, controller_b]

# Sequentially move each controller to min_position, center_position, and max_position
for controller in controllers:
    for position in ['min_position', 'center_position', 'max_position']:
        # Dynamically get the position attribute
        target_position = getattr(controller, position)
        controller.set_position(target_position)
        time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the movement to complete
        # Retrieve and print the current position
        current_position = controller.get_position()
        print(f"Controller at IP {controller.ip_address} moved to {position} ({target_position}), current position: {current_position}")

    # Optional: Additional logic can be added here for more operations

# Disconnect controllers after operations
controller_a.disconnect()
controller_b.disconnect()
#+END_SRC

In this example, controller A is set with custom speed and acceleration values, while controller B retains the default settings. Each controller is then moved through a series of positions: minimum, center, and maximum. After reaching each position, the controller's current position is retrieved using the `get_position` method and printed. This example should be enough to get you started.

** Functionality Overview

The XenaxController class provides various functions to control and manage the Xenax controllers. Below is a table summarizing each function, its parameters, and its purpose.

** Buffer Management

The combination of /send_command()/, /clear_buffer()/, and /read_response()/ ensures that each command's response is accurately captured without interference from previous commands' leftovers. This approach guarantees that the buffer remains clean, preventing situations where old responses in the buffer could lead to incorrect behavior or "weird shit". The /response()/ method allows for the retrieval of the last command's result multiple times without re-executing the command, facilitating efficient and error-free communication with the controller.

* Connecting Controllers via an Ethernet Switch

To control the XENAX controllers without a direct network connection, you can use an Ethernet switch. It is recommended that the switch should not to be connected to an external network as the controllers give themselves the IP addresses they are configured with. Ensure each controller and the controlling computer are connected to the switch. This configuration allows for isolated communication between the computer and controllers, enhancing security and reducing network interference.

** Setting Up IP Addresses on your computer (not the controller)

For communication with the controllers, the controlling computer needs to be on the same subnet (`192.168.2.0/24`). Below are the steps to configure the IP address on both Linux and Windows systems.

*** Linux (Using iproute2)

1. Open a terminal.
2. Identify the name of the Ethernet interface connected to the switch using `ip link` or `ifconfig`.
3. Assign an IP address in the `192.168.2.0/24` range to the interface. Replace `eth0` with your interface name and `192.168.2.x` with your chosen IP address.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   sudo ip addr add 192.168.2.x/24 dev eth0
   #+END_SRC
4. Confirm the IP address is assigned correctly with `ip addr show eth0`.

*** Windows

1. Open Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter settings.
2. Right-click the Ethernet connection used to connect to the switch and select Properties.
3. Select "Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)" and click Properties.
4. Choose "Use the following IP address" and enter an IP address within the `192.168.2.0/24` range (e.g., `192.168.2.x`), with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`.
5. Click OK to apply the settings.

** Verification

After setting up the IP addresses, ensure that the computer can communicate with the controllers by pinging their IP addresses.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ping 192.168.2.120  # Replace with the actual controller IP address
#+END_SRC

Successful ping responses indicate that the network configuration is correct, and you can proceed to control the controllers using the provided Python class.

* Setting up the controller IPs

In order to find the controllers connected to the ethernet switch you can use some python code, e.g.:


#+BEGIN_SRC python
import socket
import threading
from ipaddress import IPv4Network

# Target network and port
network = "192.168.2.0/24"
port = 9999
timeout = 1  # Connection timeout in seconds

def check_port(ip, port):
    try:
        with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as sock:
            sock.settimeout(timeout)
            result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
            if result == 0:
                print(f"{ip} has port {port} open.")
    except socket.error as err:
        print(f"Error checking {ip}: {err}")

def main():
    threads = []
    for ip in IPv4Network(network).hosts():
        thread = threading.Thread(target=check_port, args=(str(ip), port))
        thread.start()
        threads.append(thread)
    
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
#+END_SRC

This script will search the network and output something like this:
#+begin_src sh
$ python nmap.py 
192.168.2.101 has port 9999 open.
192.168.2.110 has port 9999 open.
#+end_src

* Using telnet to set the Controller IP Address

The controller IPs can be simply set up using the telnet client.

** Installing telnet on Windows (not tested, I don't have Windows)

1. Open Control Panel: Press ~Windows + S~, type "Control Panel" and click on it.
2. Programs and Features: Go to "Programs" and then "Programs and Features".
3. Turn Windows features on or off: On the left side, click on "Turn Windows features on or off".
4. Enable Telnet Client: Scroll down to find "Telnet Client", check the box next to it, and click "OK". Windows will install the feature.
** Using Telnet in Windows
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell: Press ~Windows + S~, type "cmd" or "PowerShell", and press Enter.
2. Connect using Telnet: Type ~telnet [IP address or domain] [port]~ and press Enter. For example, to connect to a device with IP address 192.168.1.1 on port 23, you would type ~telnet 192.168.1.1 23~.

** Accessing the controllers

Connect to the IP and Port:

#+begin_src sh
$ telnet 192.168.2.110 9999
Connected to 192.168.2.110

Entering character mode
Escape character is '^]'.
